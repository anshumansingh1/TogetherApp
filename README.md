# Together

![Feature Image](/readme_asset/TogetherApp-Feature.png)

A hobby project with an idea to build a companion app while having fun activities with friends, family and loved ones.

The app provides activities like:
 - **Never Have I Ever:** The classic Never Have I Ever game, swipe through the cards and have fun. Try long pressing the title text to enable Spicy mode ðŸ˜‰.

 - **Charades:** Act out the name by using different gestures, facial expressions, and body language. You are not allowed to talk. Long press title text to switch between Bollywood & Hollywood catalog."

 - Stay tuned for more...

## Notes from developer
 - I have done testings at my end, but since I have a limited set of devices, basically M-series, S-series Samsung and R-series Oneplus. So, please report any bug/abnormility faced by you with explanation and screenshots in the [Issues](https://github.com/anshumansingh1/TogetherApp/issues) or [Discussions](https://github.com/anshumansingh1/TogetherApp/discussions) sections, Thank You in advance â˜•.
 - Yes, I have thought of connection between two devices both in close proximity and at long distance, but because I neither have budget for a server nor enough time to work on the P2P connection, this feature is kept in the future works list.
